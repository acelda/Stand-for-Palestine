		<p>The momentum which started with social media documentation of the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in East Jerusalem (Sheik Jarrah) has catalyzed a historical moment which is ripe for transformation</p>
		<p>For the first time in 73 years of occupation the world is uniting to call Israelis apartheid, settler colonialism, and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians people for what it is.</p>
		<p>It is simple, staying neutral in situations of oppression puts you on the side of oppressor. It is the responsibility of every individual who is alive to witness this injustice to speak out in the noble plight of liberating the Palestinian people. As individuals we must pressure and hold institutions accountable to explicitly speak out against the Israeli apartheid and take a hard stance against any individual or company who is in any way invested in the apartheid.</p>
		<p>Need I remind you it was the peaceful BDS (Boy Cot Divestment and sanctions movement) which succeeded in liberating South Africa from the British apartheid in 1961. And effective method which is now being criminalized by places such as Germany and the US.</p>
		<p>The most powerful countries and companies in the world work relentlessly to sheild Israel from all consequences while financial supporting its war crimes.</p>
		<p>To the Sandberg Instituut and every other so called Liberal institution You cannot pontificate about de-colonial theory while ignoring the largest contemporary example of colonialization. We will not stand by and watch “decolonization” be reduced to a trend by educational elitism.  We are asking you NOW to sit amongst yourselves and release a statement standing against Israelis apartheid, settler colonialism, and ethnic cleansing of Palestine.</p>
		<p>Not just reposting infographics on Instagram story or cute graphic artworks. MAKE A public commitment against the occupation and post it on social media, share it via email, and actualize anti colonial practices in a tangible way.</p>
		<p>Palestine will be free and now is the moment for you to decide which side of history you will be on.</p>
